# Logistic Regression with Swift and fmincg

This is a very simple example of how to implement logistic regression in Swift, using the famous Iris dataset and a conjugate gradient optimizer.

Last updated for Swift 4.2 (Xcode 10.1).

Based on the MATLAB code from Andrew Ng's machine learning course at Coursera.

The included `Matrix` class is minimal and unoptimized for performance. For a more complete and accelerated version, [see here](https://github.com/hollance/Matrix).

For the fmincg license terms, see the comment in **fmincg.swift**. There rest of the code is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
